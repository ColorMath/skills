# The consistency oracle for colormath releases. One script, three modes, used
# by CI on every PR, by cut.sh immediately before it pushes, and by hand to
# audit tags after the fact.
#
# The invariant it enforces, in default mode:
#
#   On main, at every commit: the machine-read stamp agrees with the changelog,
#   equals the newest tag reachable from HEAD, and that tag exists.
#
# Why that is the right invariant *here*. In ColorMath/ci, where this script
# comes from, the stamps were how the repo fetched its own gate scripts at a
# consumer's pin, and a stamp naming a tag that did not exist 404'd every
# consumer's `make preflight`. Nothing in this repo resolves a version to fetch
# anything: Claude Code tracks the default branch, so the content ships on
# merge and the version is a label a person reads in `/plugin`.
#
# That leaves one load-bearing half — **the stamp equals the newest reachable
# tag, and that tag exists**. It is what makes the label answerable: a version
# in `/plugin` can be looked up as a tag, and the changelog section under that
# tag describes the code actually installed. Break it and `/plugin` reports a
# version nobody can find, which is worse than reporting none.
#
# The invariant holds continuously under the stamp-at-release model, including
# on the release commit itself, because that commit is tagged with the version
# it stamps in the same atomic push. That is what makes it safe to make
# blocking: it is already true, so it can never stand between a hotfix and main.
#
# Usage:
#   verify.sh                 default: check the working tree against the tags
#   verify.sh --expect vX.Y.Z release-time: check everything is stamped vX.Y.Z
#                             and that vX.Y.Z is a legal next tag
#   verify.sh --tag vX.Y.Z    audit: is that already-published tag self-consistent?
#   verify.sh --audit-all     audit every tag, print a table, never fail
