# Single source of truth for release notes: `cut.sh` reads them from here for
# both the annotated tag message and the GitHub Release body, so a GitHub
# Release can never say something the changelog doesn't. There is no second
# place to write release notes and therefore no second place to forget.
#
# Usage: notes.sh vX.Y.Z
#
# Prints everything between the `## vX.Y.Z — DATE` heading and the next `## `
# heading, trimmed of leading/trailing blank lines. Exits non-zero when the
# section is missing or empty — a release with no notes is a release nobody can
# review, and that is worth failing over.
