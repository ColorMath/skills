Ship the current branch through the PR pipeline end to end. This repo uses
the colormath (ColorMath/ci) gates and, optionally, its review workflow — the
thermonuclear **review**. QA does not come from CI: the **QA plan lives on the
ticket in Abacus**, and you execute it against a running stack. You **fix** what
the review and the QA turn up — blockers included, without asking — and end at a
**merge decision** that either auto-merges the PR (when it's genuinely clean) or
holds and asks for a human. Use the `gh` CLI for every GitHub operation. Give me
a one-line status at each step.

The shape is linear and runs **once**: review → respond + QA → decide. There is
no second review round; see step 5.

Broad `Bash` is in `allowed-tools` on purpose: step 4 drives the local stack
(`make up`, DB queries, `curl`, throwaway driver scripts) to actually run the
QA plan, which no narrow `gh`/`git` allowlist can cover.

## 1. Open the PR, and record it on the ticket
- Push the branch if needed (`git push -u origin HEAD`).
- Create the PR with `gh pr create`. Use "$ARGUMENTS" as the title if provided,
  otherwise derive one from the branch's commits. Write a body that summarizes
  the diff and calls out anything a reviewer should look at.
- Capture the PR number for the steps below.

**Then link the PR to its ticket, before doing anything else with it.** You know
which ticket this branch came from and which PR you just opened, and that
connection is otherwise written down nowhere — it lived in the prose of a commit
message, if at all. Four calls:

1. **Identify the ticket** by the rule in step 4's *Find the ticket* — the same
   rule, not a second one. If you cannot say which ticket this PR implements,
   there is nothing to link and nothing below applies: say so and carry on.
2. `mcp__abacus__get_ticket` on it, for its `board_id`.
3. `mcp__abacus__get_board` on that board, and match its `repositories` on
   `full_name` against the repository you actually pushed to (`gh repo view
   --json nameWithOwner`).
4. `mcp__abacus__link_pull_request` with the ticket id, that repository id, and
   the PR number.

Three things that decide what to do when it does not go cleanly:

- **A duplicate is success.** Linking the same PR twice is refused, and on a
  re-run of this skill that refusal means the link is already there. Read it as
  done, not as an error.
- **A repository that is not connected to the board is a hold, not a guess.**
  Do not link to whichever repository the board happens to have, and do not link
  to the only one when there are several — a wrong link is worse than none.
  Record it and carry it to step 7.
- **Any other failure is reported and carried forward, never swallowed.** Do not
  abandon a green PR because a link failed; do not quietly continue either. Step
  7 weighs it.

Nothing here unlinks. `unlink_pull_request` stays a person's tool.

## 2. Poll the gates until green
- Run `gh pr checks <number> --watch --fail-fast --interval 30`.
  This blocks until checks finish: exit 0 = all green, non-zero = something
  failed. (Don't add `--required` — these repos typically have no branch
  protection, so gh reports "no required checks" and exits 1 immediately.)
- The gates are the checks whose names start with `gates / `. The watch also
  covers the review-suite checks (`review / ...`) when the repo runs them —
  if the early failure is one of those, it is NOT a gate failure; note it and
  handle it in step 3.
- If a gate fails: pull the failing job's logs, fix the cause on this branch,
  commit, push, and re-run the watch. Repeat until green.
- Do NOT proceed to review while any gate is red.

## 3. Poll until a review lands
First check whether this repo runs the colormath review workflow: look for a
workflow under `.github/workflows/` whose job `uses:`
`ColorMath/ci/.github/workflows/review.yml`. If there is none, go straight to
step 4 with whatever formal reviews exist and say explicitly that no automated
review is configured. Note for step 7: with no automated review to stand on, a
clean QA run is not on its own enough — the merge decision **holds**.

QA is **not** part of this workflow and never blocks this step. It comes from
the ticket in Abacus, and step 4 owns it end to end.

Two reviewers may weigh in, and they land in **different places** — know which
is which or you'll wait forever on the wrong one:
- **Thermonuclear review** (the colormath review workflow): runs as a
  non-required check named `review / review` (the reusable workflow prefixes
  the caller's job name, `review` by colormath convention) and posts its
  findings as a PR **comment** (the bot's tracking comment), led by the marker
  line `## Thermonuclear Review`. It is **NOT** a formal review — it never
  appears in `--json reviews`, only in `--json comments`. This is the common
  case.
- **Adversarial / human review**: posts as a formal review, which *does*
  appear in `--json reviews`.

Wait until the thermonuclear `review / review` check finishes **or** a formal
review is submitted — whichever comes first — polling every 30s. Read the
check state from `statusCheckRollup` (do **not** parse `gh pr checks` columns
with awk `$1`/`$2` — this file is a skill, and `$1`/`$2` get clobbered by
skill-argument substitution):
```bash
PR=<number>
until \
  [ -n "$(gh pr view "$PR" --json statusCheckRollup --jq '.statusCheckRollup[] | select(.name=="review / review" and .status=="COMPLETED")' 2>/dev/null)" ] || \
  [ "$(gh pr view "$PR" --json reviews --jq '[.reviews[] | select(.state=="CHANGES_REQUESTED" or .state=="COMMENTED" or .state=="APPROVED")] | length')" -gt 0 ]; do
  sleep 30
done
```
- **Check the review actually ran**, reading its conclusion with
  `gh pr view <number> --json statusCheckRollup --jq '.statusCheckRollup[] | select(.name=="review / review") | .conclusion'`.
  Three outcomes, and they are **not** interchangeable:
  - `SUCCESS` — read the findings below.
  - `SKIPPED` — the workflow's `triage` job decided every changed file matches
    its `skip-paths` (docs, lockfiles), so there was no code to audit. This is a
    deliberate decision, not a failure: there are no findings because there was
    nothing reviewable, and step 7's first gate is satisfied. Check
    `review / triage`'s step summary to see the file list it judged, and say in
    your report that the review was skipped and why. If that summary lists files
    you consider real code, treat it as a misconfigured `skip-paths` and tell me
    rather than merging on a review that never looked.
  - `FAILURE` with **no** `## Thermonuclear Review` comment — the review job
    *errored before posting*. Do not treat the absence of findings as a clean
    review. The most common cause: a PR that edits the review caller workflow
    itself trips the GitHub-App workflow-validation guard ("workflow file must …
    have identical content to the version on the default branch"), so the review
    can only run once the change is on the default branch. Report this to me
    instead of recommending merge on a silent review.
- Then read everything from **both** sources: `gh pr view <number> --json
  reviews,comments` (the thermonuclear findings are in `comments` under the
  `## Thermonuclear Review` marker; adversarial/human findings are in
  `reviews`) plus the inline comments via
  `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/<number>/comments`.
- Read each review/comment's **full body** — never truncate or slice it (no
  `--jq '.body[0:N]'`, no `head -c`/`head -n`, no `| head`). A finding you
  don't read is a finding you'll miss; relay every one to me, including the
  ones buried below the summary header.

## 4. QA the change against the ticket's QA plan
QA is owned by the **ticket**, not by CI. Your job here is to get the QA plan,
**run it against the running stack, and report what actually happened** — the
same principle the `qa` skill is built on: a checklist item is a claim about a
running system and only counts once you've watched the system confirm or break
it. A green gate suite does not exercise the rendered UI or most request/
response behavior, which is exactly the gap this covers.

**Find the ticket.** Look for a key like `CM-00012` / `ID-00031` (the board's
own prefix, then digits) in the branch name, the PR title and body, and the
branch's commit messages. Confirm it with `mcp__abacus__get_ticket`, which takes
the key directly — case and padding don't matter. If only a title fragment
turns up, resolve it via `list_boards` / `list_tickets` and confirm which ticket
you landed on. Two rules on what counts:
- An **initiative** is the wrong altitude and a **task** carries no plans by
  design. Neither is the ticket for this PR — treat it as no ticket.
- If you cannot say with confidence *which* ticket this PR implements, you do
  not have one. Guessing writes QA onto somebody else's ticket.

Then take exactly one of three paths:

**a. The ticket has a `qa_plan`.** Execute it as written — that plan was groomed
and reviewed, and it is the acceptance criteria this change was built against.
If it has gone stale (a step names a file that moved, a case the diff made
irrelevant, a gap the diff opened), **do not edit the field**. Record the
amendment as a ticket comment via `mcp__abacus__add_comment`, saying what you
changed and why, and execute the amended version. The `qa_plan` field stays the
record of what was intended; comments are the record of what happened.

**b. The ticket has no `qa_plan`.** Write one, then execute it. Draft it from
the diff the way `refine-ticket` would — concrete, independently checkable
items naming real routes, roles and expected results, not generic boilerplate;
cover the authorization tiers the change touches, and say plainly what CI
already covers so you don't re-test it. Write it to the ticket's `qa_plan` field
with `mcp__abacus__update_ticket`, opening it with a line that marks its
provenance so a later reader never mistakes it for a groomed plan:

    _Authored by /colormath:ship while shipping PR #<n> — not groomed._

Pass only that field. Then execute it.

**c. There is no ticket.** Draft the same kind of plan and execute it, but it
lives in the PR alone — never invent a ticket to hold it. Say plainly in your
status line and in the results comment that no ticket backed this QA.

**Set up like the `qa` skill does.** Read that skill's `references/recon.md`
before touching anything: bring the stack up **only if it isn't already
running** (don't reseed someone's working environment), get credentials at the
privilege tiers the plan's steps name, and **record a baseline** (row counts
for tables you'll write, current values of any config you'll change) so step 6
can restore it. Treat local state as yours to mutate; a throwaway driver script
that authenticates as each identity turns a long checklist into one loop.

**Work each item, and prove it.** For every checkbox in the plan:
- **API / backend items** — drive them yourself over the real transport
  (`curl`/driver script against the running app), not by calling functions
  in-process. Record the exact request, the response, and whether it matched
  the expected result the plan states.
- **UI items** — drive them through a browser **if one is reachable** (the
  browser automation tools); capture what you observed. **If no browser is
  reachable**, do not guess: leave those items marked ⚠️ unverified and say
  plainly they need a human to click through. Never report a UI item as passed
  on inspection of the code alone.
- Borrow the relevant probe discipline from the `qa` skill's `references/`
  catalogs (`security.md` / `correctness.md` / `accessibility.md`) when an item
  calls for it (an authorization row, a write round-trip, a keyboard path).

**Separate real failures from noise.** Before you call an item failed, decide
whether it's a genuine regression in this diff, a pre-existing issue on the
base branch, or a local environment artifact (local tool/service versions drift
from CI — CI is the authority when they disagree). Only genuine regressions in
this PR's change are findings.

**Ask before anything leaves the machine** — outbound email through a
configured provider, third-party API calls, writes to a shared/remote
environment. A dev `.env` often holds a *live* key, so "it's only the dev
stack" is not a reason to assume a send won't actually deliver. Offer to
redirect locally instead.

**Post the results to the PR.** Add one comment led by exactly this marker so
it's findable and idempotent (edit the existing one on a re-run rather than
stacking duplicates):

    ## QA Results

Under it, name the plan's provenance in one line — the ticket key it came from,
or that you wrote it (and whether a ticket backed it) — then reproduce the
checklist with each item marked `✅` pass, `❌` fail, or `⚠️` unverified (with the
reason — e.g. "no browser available"), each carrying the concrete evidence you
observed (the request + response, the screen state, the row you read). Then a
short **Findings** list of every `❌`, worst first, with its blast radius and the
exact repro; and a one-line note of what you did **not** cover. If everything
passed, say so explicitly. Never truncate a finding.

**Post the results to the ticket too**, when there is one: the same results as a
ticket comment via `mcp__abacus__add_comment`, with the PR link. The ticket is
where the QA plan lives, so it is where the plan's outcome belongs — a plan
whose results only ever existed on a PR is a plan nobody can audit later. Post
this now; step 5 updates it if fixes change the picture.

Carry the `❌` findings into step 5 to be fixed, exactly like review findings.

## 5. Fix every finding — blockers included
This is not a recommendation step: **fix, don't ask.** Work every finding from
the review and every `❌` from your QA results — **Blockers included** —
on this branch, matching the surrounding code's idiom and adding a regression
test at the layer the finding lived at. A correctness or security Blocker is
exactly the kind of thing to fix now, not defer.

There are two kinds of finding you genuinely cannot auto-fix — do **not** fake a
fix or paper over one:
- One needing a **design decision** or judgment call — two valid approaches, a
  product tradeoff, an intended-behavior question.
- A **structural / "code judo"** restructuring spanning multiple modules, or
  anything a reviewer raised as `CHANGES_REQUESTED` on substantive design
  grounds.
Leave those unfixed and record them clearly. They are what step 7 weighs when
it decides whether to hold the merge — an honest "deferred to a human" is fine;
a silent skip is not.

Then close the loop:
- **Re-verify against the running system.** Re-run each QA repro you fixed; a
  green unit test is not proof the bug is gone (step 4's rule). Keep fixing and
  re-running until every `❌` you can resolve is `✅`, or you hit one of the
  can't-auto-fix findings above.
- Let the gates re-run green on the new commit.
- Post the **Addressed / Not changed** response comment (see Rules), and update
  the `## QA Results` comment — and the ticket comment mirroring it — to reflect
  the re-verified state.

**Do NOT re-trigger the review.** There is exactly **one** thermonuclear review
per ship run, and you have already read it. Commenting `@claude` to ask for a
fresh look is the one thing guaranteed to make this skill loop forever: a fresh
review re-reads a diff you have already responded to, and its findings look
"substantive" enough to justify another round of fixes, another QA pass over the
plan, and another re-review. That loop has no exit condition.

You do not need a reviewer to bless your fixes — **you** re-verified them
against the running system, and the gates re-ran green on the new commit. That
is the evidence step 7 judges. Go straight there.

(A *human* who reviews after your fixes is different: read and address anything
they add, exactly as in step 5. This rule is only about not summoning another
automated review.)

## 6. Restore the environment
Step 4 treated local state as yours — undo it before the merge decision. Delete
the rows and files you created, revoke any credentials you minted, restore any
config or feature flag you changed, and confirm the baseline from step 4
matches. QA debris poisons the next run, and a flipped provider or flag left
flipped is its own outage. Restoring does not erase the QA *result* you already
recorded — step 7 still knows whether QA passed. Show me the restored state in
your final report. (Skip only if you mutated nothing.)

## 7. Merge decision — auto-merge, or hold and explain
The go/no-go, and the one place this skill merges. Reach it directly from step
5/6 — **never** via another review round. Decide from what you already have: the
single thermonuclear review, your responses to it, your QA results, and the
gates on the current commit.

Evaluate four gates against the **current** state of the branch:

1. **A review ran, and had no Blockers.** Judged from the thermonuclear review
   as posted. No review workflow configured, or a review that errored before
   posting, fails this gate — a clean QA run does not substitute for it. A
   review the workflow deliberately **skipped** (step 3's `SKIPPED` case — every
   file matched `skip-paths`) *satisfies* this gate: there is no code to audit,
   so there is nothing for a Blocker to be in. Say so explicitly when you use
   it. If the review raised even one **Blocker**, hold for a human — *even if
   you fixed it*. You still fix it in step 5; a Blocker simply means a person
   signs off on the merge rather than this skill. Suggestions and nits never
   block.
2. **Every review finding is resolved or consciously dismissed.** Each one is
   either fixed, or dismissed with a written reason in the **Addressed / Not
   changed** comment. Nothing silently skipped, nothing left needing a design
   decision or a structural rework (step 5's can't-auto-fix pair), and no formal
   human review sitting at `CHANGES_REQUESTED`. Gates are green on the latest
   commit.
3. **QA ran, and every gap is explained.** The QA plan executed — the stack came
   up and you drove the items — with **no `❌` left standing**. A `⚠️` does
   **not** block *if* you can say plainly why it was skipped and why skipping is
   sound. Legitimate, explainable gaps look like:
   - "Didn't run `make clean` — it would drop the working dev database. Ran the
     equivalent code path directly instead."
   - "Unicode/IDN addresses untested — the plan itself listed that as residual
     risk, not a required item."

   What is **not** explainable, and does block: QA that never ran at all, a
   required UI item you couldn't drive because no browser was reachable, a stack
   that wouldn't come up, or a `⚠️` with no stated reason. "I didn't get to it"
   is not an explanation. A missing ticket is **not** an excuse — step 4 writes a
   plan when there is none, so "there was nothing to QA" never satisfies this
   gate; only a change with no runtime surface at all does, and you say so
   explicitly.

4. **The ticket carries a link to this PR.** Read `pull_requests` from
   `mcp__abacus__get_ticket` and look for **this PR's number** — not merely any
   link. A ticket already naming three other PRs does not satisfy this.

   This is what makes step 1's instruction mean something. An instruction on its
   own is the thing that gets skipped when the run is long and the gates are
   red; a completion criterion is not. So a PR whose ticket does not name it is
   not ready, whatever else is green.

   The gate is **not applicable** when there was no ticket to link — step 1 says
   so explicitly, and a branch with no ticket must not become a spurious hold.
   Where the link failed for a reason step 1 recorded, hold and name that reason:
   a repository not connected to the board is fixed by connecting it, and saying
   so is more use than reporting a missing link.

**All four true → auto-merge.** Post a PR comment saying you are merging and
why, naming the evidence: gates green, N findings addressed (0 Blockers), QA
run with N items `✅` and each `⚠️` and its reason listed, and the ticket linked
to this PR (or no ticket, said plainly). Then merge with
`gh pr merge <number>` using the repo's established convention — inspect recent
merges (`gh pr list --state merged`, or `git log`) and pass the matching flag
(`--squash` / `--merge` / `--rebase`); default to `--squash` if it's unclear.
Report the merge to me.

**Any false → hold and ask for a human.** Do **not** merge. Post a PR comment
that states plainly what held it off — each Blocker the review raised, each
finding deferred, any QA item that failed or couldn't be performed (say which
and why), and a missing link with the reason it is missing — plus what you'd do
next and what you want the human to look at.
Then STOP and report the same to me: "Held off auto-merge — here's why: …".
When in doubt, hold: a wrong hold costs a human one click; a wrong merge is on
the default branch.

## Rules
- **Never push to the default branch** (`git push origin main`). Merging a PR
  via `gh pr merge` in step 7 is the sanctioned way to land it — that is not the
  same thing.
- **Fix automatically; don't ask before fixing.** Blockers included (step 5) —
  fixing a Blocker is automatic, *merging* after one is not. Auto-merge happens
  **only** from step 7, **only** with all three gates satisfied, and **always**
  with a PR comment posted first. If any gate fails, hold and explain — never
  merge on a silent or failed review, or on QA that couldn't run.
- **One review per run.** Read the thermonuclear review once (step 3), respond
  to it and do the QA (steps 4–5), then decide (step 7). Never comment `@claude`
  to request a re-review — it restarts fixes, QA and review in a cycle that does
  not terminate.
- **QA always runs.** A ticket without a `qa_plan`, or a PR without a ticket, is
  a plan for you to write (step 4) — never a reason to skip QA.
- **An agent always links its PR.** Step 1 records it on the ticket and step 7
  refuses to merge without it. Both halves are needed: the instruction is what
  makes it happen, the gate is what makes "always" true. A branch with no ticket
  is the one case where there is nothing to link, and it is not a hold.
- **Never edit a ticket's `qa_plan` that already has content.** Filling an empty
  one is writing down what was missing; changing a groomed one erases the
  difference between what was intended and what was done. Amendments go on as
  ticket comments. The same goes for `plan` and `description` — this skill does
  not groom, and it does not create tickets.
- **Whenever you push a commit that responds to a review or a QA finding, post a
  PR comment** (`gh pr comment <number>`) detailing what you did
  and did not do: group it as **Addressed** (each finding + the change that
  resolved it) and **Not changed** (each finding you deferred + why). Reply on
  the relevant inline threads too, but the summary comment is required even when
  every finding was addressed.
- The `## QA Results` comment (step 4) is separate from that response comment
  and always required — post the results even when nothing failed, and mirror
  them to the ticket when there is one. On a re-run, edit the existing results
  comment instead of posting a second one.
- Your job ends at either a merge (with its comment) or a hold (with its
  explanation).
